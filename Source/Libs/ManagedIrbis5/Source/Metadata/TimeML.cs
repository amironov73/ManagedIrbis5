// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeML
//
// TimeML is a set of rules for encoding documents electronically.
// It is defined in the TimeML Specification version 1.2.1 developed
// by several efforts, led in large part by the Laboratory for
// Linguistics and Computation at Brandeis University.
//
// The TimeML project's goal is to create a standard markup language
// for temporal events in a document. TimeML addresses four problems
// regarding event markup, including time stamping (with which
// an event is anchored to a time), ordering events with respect
// to one another, reasoning with contextually underspecified temporal
// expressions, and reasoning about the length of events and their outcomes.
