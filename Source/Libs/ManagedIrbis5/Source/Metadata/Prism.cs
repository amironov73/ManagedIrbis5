//
// The Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata (PRISM)
// specification defines a set of XML metadata vocabularies for syndicating,
// aggregating, post-processing and multi-purposing content. PRISM provides
// a framework for the interchange and preservation of content and metadata,
// a collection of elements to describe that content, and a set
// of controlled vocabularies listing the values for those elements.
// PRISM can be XML, RDF/XML, or XMP and incorporates Dublin Core elements.
// PRISM can be thought of as a set of XML tags used to contain
// the metadata of articles and even tag article content.
//
// PRISM conforms to the World Wide Web standard for Namespaces.
// PRISM namespaces are PRISM (prism:), PRISM Usage Rights (pur:),
// Dublin Core (dc: and dcterms:), PRISM Inline Metadata (pim:),
// PRISM Rights Language (prl:), PRISM Aggregator Message (pam:),
// and PRISM Controlled Vocabulary (pcv:). PRISM incorporated existing
// industry standards such as Dublin Core and XHTML in order to leverage
// work that had already been done in the publishing industry.
// New elements were created only when required, and were assigned
// to PRISM specific namespaces.
//
// PRISM consists of three specifications. The PRISM Specification,
// itself, provides definition for the overall PRISM framework.
// A second specification, the PRISM Aggregator Message (PAM) Schema/DTD,
// is a standard format for publishers to use for delivery of content
// to websites, aggregators, and syndicators. PAM is available
// as an XML DTD and an XML schema (XSD). Both PAM formats provides
// a simple, flexible model for transmitting content and PRISM metadata.
// The third, and newest, specification provides an XML schema (XSD)
// for capture of content usage rights metadata. This Guide to PRISM Usage
// Rights utilizes the elements found in PRISM’s Usage Rights Namespace
// to allow users to comprehensively capture and relay rights metadata
// for text and media content.
//
// In 1999, IDEAlliance contracted Linda Burman to found the PRISM
// Working Group to address emerging publisher requirements for
// a metadata standard to facilitate “agile” content for search,
// digital asset management, content aggregation. Since that time,
// individuals from more than 50 IDEAlliance member companies have
// participated in the development of the specifications.
//
// PRISM is an IDEAlliance specification but is available free of charge.
// IDEAlliance (International Digital Enterprise Alliance)
// is a not-for-profit membership organization. Its mission is
// to advance user-driven, cross-industry solutions for all publishing
// and content-related processes by developing standards, fostering
// business alliances, and identifying best practices.
//
// Many organizations use PRISM because it provides a common metadata
// standard across platforms, media types and business units.
// Organizations who are involved in any type of content creation,
// categorization, management, aggregation and distribution, both
// commercially and within intranet and extranet frameworks can use
// the PRISM standards.
//
// The PRISM Working Group is open to all IDEAlliance members and
// includes: Adobe Systems, Hachette Filipacchi Media, Hearst,
// L.A. Burman Associates, LexisNexis, The McGraw-Hill Companies,
// Reader’s Digest, Source Interlink Media Companies, Time Inc.,
// The Nature Publishing Group, and U.S. News & World Report.
//
// PRISM can be incorporated into other standards and at this time,
// the PRISM Working Group is only aware of PRISM incorporation
// with RSS 1.0. See RSS 1.0[2] and the RSS 1.0 PRISM Module
// for more information.
//
// The PRISM specification defines a set of metadata vocabularies.
// PRISM metadata may be expressed in a different syntax depending
// on the specific use-case scenario. Currently PRISM metadata
// can be encoded XML, XML/RDF, or as XMP. Each of these expressions
// of PRISM metadata is called a profile.
//
// * Profile 1 is for the expression of PRISM metadata in XML.
// An example is the XML PRISM Aggregator Message (PAM).
// * Profile 2 is for the expression of PRISM metadata in XML/RDF
// such as for expressing PRISM metadata in RSS feeds.
// * Profile 3 is for embedding PRISM metadata in media objects
// such as digital images or PDFs using XMP technology.
//
// PRISM describes many components of print, online, mobile,
// and multimedia content including the following:
//
// * Who created, contributed to, and owns the rights to the content?
// * What locations, organizations, topics, people, and/or events it covers, the media it contains, and under what conditions it may be reproduced?
// * When it was published? (cover date, post date, volume, number), withdrawn?
// * Where it can be republished, and the original platform on which it appeared?
// * How it can be reused?
//
// Common PRISM Usage
//
// * Syndication to partners
// * Content aggregation
// * Content repurposing
// * Resource discovery and search optimization
// * Multiple platform and channel distribution
// * Content archiving
// * Capture rights usage information
// * Creation of feeds, such as RSS
// * Standalone services
// * Embedded descriptions, such as XMP
// * Web publishing
