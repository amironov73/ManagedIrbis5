//
// BIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework) is a data model for bibliographic
// description. BIBFRAME was designed to replace the MARC standards,
// and to use linked data principles to make bibliographic data more
// useful both within and outside the library community.
//
// History
//
// The MARC Standards, which BIBFRAME seeks to replace, were developed
// by Henriette Avram at the US Library of Congress during the 1960s.
// By 1971, MARC formats had become the national standard for dissemination
// of bibliographic data in the United States, and the international
// standard by 1973.
//
// In a provocatively titled 2002 article, library technologist Roy Tennant
// argued that "MARC Must Die", noting that the standard was old;
// used only within the library community; and designed to be a display,
// rather than a storage or retrieval format. A 2008 report from
// the Library of Congress wrote that MARC is "based on forty-year
// old techniques for data management and is out of step with programming
// styles of today."
//
// In 2012, the Library of Congress announced that it had contracted
// with Zepheira, a data management company, to develop a linked data
// alternative to MARC. Later that year, the library announced a new model
// called MARC Resources (MARCR). That November, the library released
// a more complete draft of the model, renamed BIBFRAME.
//
// The Library of Congress released version 2.0 of BIBFRAME in 2016.
//
// Design
//
// BIBFRAME is expressed in RDF and based on three categories of abstraction
// (work, instance, item), with three additional classes (agent, subject,
// event) that relate to the core categories. While the work entity
// in BIBFRAME may be "considered as the union of the disjoint work
// and expression entities" in IFLA's Functional Requirements
// for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) entity relationship model,
// BIBFRAME's instance entity is analogous to the FRBR manifestation
// entity. This represents an apparent break with FRBR and the FRBR-based
// Resource Description and Access (RDA) cataloging code. However,
// the original BIBFRAME model argues that the new model "can reflect
// the FRBR relationships in terms of a graph rather than as hierarchical
// relationships, after applying a reductionist technique." Since
// both FRBR and BIBFRAME have been expressed in RDF, interoperability
// between the two models is technically possible.
//
// Specific formats
//
// While the BIBFRAME model currently includes a serial entity, there
// are still a number of issues to be addressed before the model can
// be used for serials cataloging. BIBFRAME lacks several serials-related
// data fields available in MARC.
//
// A 2014 report was very positive on BIBFRAME's suitability for
// describing audio and video resources. However, the report also
// expressed some concern about the high-level Work entity, which
// is unsuitable for modeling certain audio resources.
//
// Implementations
//
// Colorado College's Tutt Library has created several experimental
// apps using BIBFRAME.
// 14 other research libraries are testing the model.
// ExLibris published a roadmap to implement BIBFRAME in its library
// systems, which includes a MARC-to-BIBFRAME transformation.
//
// Related initiatives and standards
//
// RDA, FRBR, FRBRoo, FRAD, and FRSAD are available in RDF in the
// Open Metadata Registry, a metadata registry.
// Schema Bib Extend project, a W3C-sponsored community group has
// worked to extend Schema.org to make it suitable for bibliographic
// description.
